# Sagebrush Ecosystem Modeling

This repository explores the accuracy of 1x1m LIDAR Canopy Height Models, 30x30m multispectral, and 30x30m hyperspectral imagery in reconstructing sagebrush ecosystems in the western United States. It will produce workflows that analyze vegetation structure through CHM models and vegetation composition via spectral imagery. The objective of this repository is to determine the percent coverage of sagebrush/shrub and grass/low-growing vegetation coverage as well as the diversity of grass and/or forbs in historically sagebrush territories. Data is sourced from the National Ecological Observatory Network's (NEON) insitu and aerial records, NASA and JPL's Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) images, and the United States Geological Survey's (USGS) LANDSAT images

# Relevance
Sagebrush ecosystems cover much of the western United States and parts of southwestern Canada. Sagebrush ecosystems provide essential forage and habitat for approximately 350 other species of plants an animals, some of which, like the Greater Sage Grouse, are found only in sagebrush habitat. Sagebrush ecosystems are increasingly fragmented through anthropogenic land use, invasive species, and changes in wildfire duration and frequency which are amplified by climate change. While sagebrush still covers much of the western United States, only 10% of current habitats are considered unaffected by fragmentation. Consequently, many plants and animals associated with sagebrush are losing essential habitat and some qualify as endangered or threatened species per the Endangered Species Act. Conservation efforts targeted to sagebrush ecosystems are costly as they require the surveilance and upkeep of millions of acres of public and private land.

This repository offers an alternative to traditional land monitoring strategies through its unique focus on and analyses of sagebrush ecosystems. We expect this code to be useful to other analysts because of its reproducible foundation, which will allow it to be applied to other research areas. While we are using it here to examine sagebrush habitat, the same processes can be run on other sites covered by the aforementioned agencies, allowing versatile analyses of vegetaion structure and composition across the United States.
